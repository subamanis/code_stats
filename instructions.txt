-------- When you want to add a new command/flag follow these steps:

1) Add a constant str with the command name on top of config_manager  
2) Add an else if case for the command when creating the configuration
3) Add the command to the Configuration and ConfigurationBuilder structs and to their "new" methods
4) Add the command as argument to methods "combine_specified_config_options", "has_missing_field", "add_missing_field"
5) Add and else if case for the command for the reading of it from a config file ("parse_config_file")
6) Write the command when creating a config file ("save_config_to_file")
7) Add code to handle the functionality of the command wherever applicable
