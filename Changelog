v1.0.0-beta1  -  17/10/2021  

  4,766 Total lines  -  3,464 Code lines

Bugfixes:
  -> Saving a configuration will now only save the specified flags, and not the rest with
      default values, so that they can be overriden by the default configuration.

Main changes:
  -> The previously necessary "data" folder, gets now baked in the executable, at compile time.
      On the first execution, the folder gets written on a persistent path in the user's machine,
      according to platform specifications, and for every other execution, the necessary data
      is read from there, so the user can manually modify the languages.
  -> The producer (the part that traverses the given dirs to find relevant files) is now paralellized.
      Performance may increase on cold runs, especially on machines with logical core count > 4.
  -> Language files now support up to 2 comment symbols.


New commands:
  -> Added the --no-keywords flag, that disables keyword counting and printing.
  -> Added the --changelog command, that displays the changelog history and terminates execution.
  -> Added the --show-languages command, that displays the language files that were found.
  -> Added the --show-configs commands, that displays the configuration files that were found.

Change in commands:
  -> (Breaking: update config files) Change on the --threads command's arguments, to reflect the ability
      to specify the amount of producers and consumers, separately.
  -> Added support for log descriptions. Now, after the '--log' command, you can write a word or a sentence
      that describes the state of the codebase at the time the logging was done. 
  -> Normal program executions and --help command, will now display the version ID of the program.
  -> Running the --help command will now work even if there is no data dir.
  -> If a command was provided with invalid arguments, the help message for this command
      will also be displayed.

Dependencies: 
  -> num_cpus = "1.13.0"  was introduced, so that the program can automatically detect
      an optimal number of threads for producers and consumers.
  -> directories = "4.0.1"  was introduced, so that platform-specific and suitable paths can be chosen for
      saving the persistent data of the application in the user machine.
  -> include_dir = "0.6.2"  was introduced, so that the "data" folder provided with the repository can be
      conveniently baked in the executable.

Other:
  -> Running the program with no arguments will now just display the help message.
  -> The program will now also display how many files it ignored due to the '--exclude' command.
  -> 7 more language files bundled by default.  
  -> Added the .h extension in the C++ language file, along the .cpp and .hpp extensions.
